my openbsd dotfiles
---

about:
X is started using xenodm(1). xenodm shows login screen, and upon login
it runs ~/.xsession. This file exports PATH, starts the bar and xbanish,
sets environment, and _language_ (you should probably configure the last one),
and runs the cwm(1) window manager. I have some weird customizations in .cwmrc,
so you should probably change them. Also, i use patched version of urxvt
(patched manually with 
	https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rxvt-unicode-truecolor-wide-glyphs)

Also, the font is agave nerd font.

To use them you'll need:
- lemonbar-xft with bsd_bar from https://github.com/krzysckh/bin
  (my bar script)
- openbsd-backgrounds
- scrot
- xclip

Also, consider installing:
- plan9port
- figlet
- mpv
- nsxiv
- jq
- git
- xbanish
- zathura{-pdf-mupdf,-ps}
- yt-dlp
- wtf
- vim
- firefox

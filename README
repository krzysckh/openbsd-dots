about:
X is started using xenodm(1). xenodm shows login screen, and upon login
it runs ~/.xsession. This file exports PATH, starts the bar and xbanish,
sets environment, and _language_ (you should probably configure the last one),
and runs the dwm window manager.  Also, i use patched version of urxvt (patched
manually with
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rxvt-unicode-truecolor-wide-glyphs)

Also, the font is Lilex.

To use them you'll need:
- my dwm build from https://pub.krzysckh.org/dwm.tgz
- bsd_bar from https://github.com/krzysckh/bin (my bar script)
- wallpaper (outdated) from https://pub.krzysckh.org/wallpaper.png - now
  openbsd-backgrounds
- scrot
- xclip

Also, consider installing:
- emacs
- plan9port
- figlet
- mpv
- nsxiv
- jq
- git
- xbanish
- zathura{-pdf-mupdf,-ps}
- yt-dlp
- wtf
- vim
- firefox
